[ ] create form on this view that allows user to select a nice site id, model
on the existing admin addsite view.

[ ] copy user property sheet from old site to new, so they get email and
fullname, etc

[ ] figure out how to prevent installation of other add-ons in new site,
including our own, without crippling user. Can we just give the 'Site
Administrator' role to new site owner?

[ ] login user automagically on redirect to new site, so they don't have to do
it themselves

[ ] forward user to site admin, site control panel so they can complete set up

[ ] provide management tools to review what sites exist and when and how they 
were created.

[ ] link created site to site_record somehow.  (store new site url??)
